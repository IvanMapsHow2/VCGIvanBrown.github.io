## **[+]** Positives of Markdown
- It's easier to code web content by writing Markdown than by directly writing HTML (creating and filling XML tags).  

- When in raw form--Markdown outside of platform that converts Markdown), it generally remains human-readable.  

- Many projects--e.g., GitHub repository--use Markdown for documentation.  


## **[-]** Negatives of Markdown
- Like pre-Web2.0 HTML and browsers, a Markdown file can present very differently across platforms.  

- It can't do everything that HTML can do.  

- Very limited page-layout options.  

- It's not anywhere close to capabilities of rich content-writing/content-structuring tools.
